        <p>You are the captain of a spaceship named "The Flying Hippo." One day, you're working on tuning up your ship's engines when you get an urgent message on your space phone:</p>
        <p>"Captain, one of our Mars robots is sick. We need you to go to Mars immediately and retrieve it so that we can fix it and download the results of its important experiments."</p>
        <p>You remember that you're supposed to go to a meeting of the Space Scouts tonight, and you were really looking forward to it. But, on the other hand, the other Space Scouts would understand that this mission is very important.</p>
        <p>What do you do? Go to Mars, or stay home?</p>

        <p>Great choice! Mars is lovely this time of year (or, during the time of the year when you'll arrive, about 260 days from now!).</p>
        <p>You pack up your things and prepare enough food for the journey, then take off!</p>
        <p>Launch goes smoothly and you sit back, put on your headphones, and prepare for a relaxing trip.</p>
        <p>A week later, things are going great. There's nothing for you to do except read, listen to music, and watch movies. Just then, you hear a strange sound.</p>
        <p>"meow."</p>
        <p>It sounds like Gizmo, your cat! She must have snuck aboard while you were packing!</p>
        <p>You're happy to have the company, but you didn't pack enough food for the both of you, and there certainly isn't a grocery store on the way to Mars.</p>
        <p>You have a choice: risk running out of food on the return trip, or you can eat gizmo to survive. What will you do?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer12">
        <p>You decide to stay home. They'll get someone else to fly to Mars. Besides, you heard that they're going to have free pizza at the Space Scouts meeting!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="err1">
        <p>Please answer Mars or Earth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer21">
        <p>You decide to risk it. The journey is long, and you give sweet Gizmo half your food, knowing that you may not survive the return trip, but the Flying Hippo can carry the robot home without you, and at least the important experimental data (and
            Gizmo, of course) will be safe.</p>
        <p>When you arrive at Mars, you quickly locate the sick robot. But, you also discover something else: a large ice chest full of delicious sandwiches! The last repair crew to visit the robot must have left this here! You unwrap one of the sandwiches
            and carefully take a bite. Peanut butter! Your favorite! Gizmo's favorite too!</p>
        <p>You pack up the sandwiches and the sick robot and begin the trip home, knowing that there's now more than enough food for both you and Gizmo.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer22">
        <p>You must complete your mission and get to Mars.</p>
        <p>Eat Gizmo now and save the other food for the trip back home.</p>
        <p>After eating Gizmo you become very sad and lonely again but it might have just saved your life.</p>
        <p>You land on mars and find a large ice chest filled with delicious sandwiches that were left by the last crew who came to</p>
        <p>Filled with regret and dissapointment you load the sick robot onboard and head back to earth.</p>
        <p>Once back on earth you go and buy a new Gizmo, all happy again.</p>
